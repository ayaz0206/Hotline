**Makers Academy Final Project**

- People new to coding often find it difficult to explain their code problems in text-form on services such as Stackoverflow. This is because they lack the knowledge and experience to communicate with other developers in a technical way. To lower the barrier to getting help, I conceived askadev.com. Users can submit a video question, as well as their code, and receive a video response. Askadev.com also facilitates live pair-coding, helping people overcome problems quicker and learn faster. 

- Technologies used: OAuth from Google and integrated Google hangouts for video. Other technologies include Ruby on Rail, Postgresql JS, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
